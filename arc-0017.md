# ARC 0017

We proposed stateless smart contract to be the ARC standard: [https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/issues/68](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/issues/68)

Advantages of stateless solution:

* Costs one transaction less (no app call)
* Less complex code (much more secure)
* Market maker owns the key (fully decentralized)

ARC 0017 is simple stateless approval program, which lets user to sell one asset and set the price for another asset. Seller sends the asset to the escrow account (hash of the approval code). To execute the order the buyer group two transactions into one group. Algorand blockchain will allow to add it to the blockchain only if both transactions will be processed. Seller can cancel order any time by executing close txs on the order.&#x20;
